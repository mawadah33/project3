            <h1>Symptoms:</h1>

            <img src="img/Symptoms1.jpg" style="float:right; width: 300px; height:300" <p>You may have a color vision deficiency and not know it.<br> Some people figure out that they or their <br> child has the condition when it causes<br> confusion such
            as when there are problems differentiating the<br> colors in a traffic light or interpreting color-coded learning materials.</p>
            <p> People affected by color blindness may not be able to distinguish:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Different shades of red and green</li>
                <li>Different shades of blue and yellow</li>
                <li>Any colors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The most common color deficiency is an inability to see some shades of red <br>and green. Often, a person who is red-green or blue-yellow deficient isn't completely<br> insensitive to both colors. Defects can be mild, moderate or severe.</p>

            <h1>When should you see a doctor:</h1>
            <p>When you notice a change in color vision.</p>

            <h1>How is the diagnosis made?</h1>

            <p>Color discrimination is a personal sign and not an objective one, as it is impossible for anyone to know<br> the way another person distinguishes colours, and therefore it is not possible to rely on the patientâ€™s complaint or the way he describes
                colours. There are a group<br> of tests that the doctor can rely on to diagnose color blindness</p>

            <h2>Perform an eye examination.</h2>

            <img src="img/Symptoms2.jpg" style="float:right; width: 300px; height:300" <p>Before starting color blindness tests, the doctor must conduct an eye examination<br> to look for poor vision, neurological problems, glaucoma, or other eye problems
            and ensure the safety of vision and the safety of all parts of the eye.</p>

            <h2>Color blindness test:</h2>
            <p>The color blindness test is a visual test composed of panels called pseudochromatic panels. These panels contain<br> images colored dotly in one of the colors and within the color a number or symbol embedded in the image. Only a person with
                normal vision can distinguish<br> color and symbol together, while a color-blind patient may see the number without the color or the color without the number or symbol.
                <br> It is important for children to be tested before they start school because many early childhood educational subjects involve identifying colours.</p>
